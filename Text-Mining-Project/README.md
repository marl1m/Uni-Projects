## Decoding the Rhythms of Emotion: A sentimental Journey through Music Genres


During a Text Mining class several preprocessing, vectorization, and modeling techniques were taught and put into practice in this project.
In the original dataset, the main feature consists in the music's lyrics. 
The purpose of my analysis was to predict which genre the music was about and the respective emotions inside the lyrics.
