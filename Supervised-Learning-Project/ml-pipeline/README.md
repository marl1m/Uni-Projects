# Classification Pipeline: Building a Scalable ML Workflow
##### Machine Learning Project

##

### Project Description
This machine learning project presents a complete classification pipeline, covering every step from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction. It uses various supervised learning techniques and feature selection strategies to train and optimize models for accurate prediction. The project reflects good practice in modular code organization and reproducibility.

#### Objectives:
1. **Prepare and Preprocess Data**
   - Load, clean, encode and scale data to ensure it's suitable for ML models.

2. **Feature Engineering and Selection**
   - Apply multiple techniques (Mutual Information, RFE, SelectFromModel) to select relevant features and reduce dimensionality.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Train baseline and advanced models using cross-validation and performance metrics.
   - Models include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVC, Logistic Regression, and more.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Leverage RandomizedSearchCV to improve model performance.

5. **Submission File Generation**
   - Make predictions on test data and output results in a submission-ready format.

##

### Repository Description
This repo contains all code, data references, and outputs for the pipeline. Itâ€™s organized as follows:

- [`data`](data): Folder containing raw input data files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `sample_submission.csv`).
- [`notebooks`](notebooks): Jupyter notebooks used during initial exploration or debugging.
- [`src`](src): Core logic split into Python modules:
  - `data_loader.py`: Loading data.
  - `preprocessing.py`: Handling missing data, encoding, and scaling.
  - `feature_selection.py`: Feature selection routines.
  - `model_training.py`: Model training and basic evaluation.
  - `model_tuning.py`: Hyperparameter optimization.
  - `predict.py`: Test set predictions and submission file generation.
- [`outputs`](outputs): Outputs from model training and inference.
  - `models/`: Trained model artifacts (optional).
  - `predictions/`: Submission CSVs.

### Possible Improvements
- Add experiment tracking (e.g. MLflow or Weights & Biases).
- Use pipelines (`sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`) for better encapsulation.
- Add model interpretability tools (e.g. SHAP, LIME).
- Deploy best model via REST API or streamlit demo.
